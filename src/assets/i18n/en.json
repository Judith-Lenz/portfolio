    "HEADLINE": "About me",
    "INTRO": "I love problem-solving – it feels like solving an exciting puzzle. When everything finally works, it’s a great feeling. My goal is to work remotely and combine psychology with IT. Seeing others build projects from scratch inspires me to keep going and grow.",
    "PARAGRAPH1": "I live in Augsburg but am very open to new ways of working. Remote work excites me because it offers freedom and flexibility. In the long term, I’d love to work location-independently – maybe even abroad.",
    "PARAGRAPH2": "I enjoy exploring new technologies – learning feels like a treasure hunt. I love understanding how things work and cherish every “aha” moment. The more I learn, the more curious I become.",
    "PARAGRAPH3": "I work in an analytical, structured, and creative way. I like thinking outside the box and staying persistent until I find a solution. For me, it’s not just about a solution – it has to truly make sense in the bigger picture."
